/**
 * @brief Utility class for handling non-blocking delays.
 * 
 * @details
 * This class provides a simple mechanism to measure elapsed time without
 * blocking the program flow, similar to how `millis()` or `micros()` are used
 * in Arduino environments. It stores a configurable delay interval in 
 * microseconds and internally tracks the last reference timestamp.
 * 
 * Typical usage:
 * - Call `init(delayTime)` to set up the desired delay interval.
 * - Repeatedly call `isDelayTimeElapsed()` in a loop to check if the delay has passed.
 * - Use `restartTimer()` to reset the timer when the delay condition is met.
 * - The delay interval can be changed dynamically with `updateDelayTime()`.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - The empty constructor `Delay()` is provided but should be avoided 
 *   (it does not initialize the timer).
 * - Designed for microcontroller environments where precise non-blocking timing is required.
